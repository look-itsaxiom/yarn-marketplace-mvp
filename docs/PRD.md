# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product name (working)
Yarn Marketplace

## Problem statement
Yarn buyers and sellers are fragmented across Etsy, eBay, Mercari, FB groups, Instagram, and Ravelry. Sellers cross‑post and manage DMs across platforms; buyers struggle to find good deals and trusted listings.

## Goals
- Centralize listings for destashing and bundle sales
- Reduce seller friction (list once, smarter shipping)
- Improve buyer discovery of deals and lots

## Non‑goals (MVP)
- Full payment processing (initially connect + offers)
- International shipping support
- Advanced moderation tooling

## Target users
- **Buyer**: hobbyist yarn shopper, deal‑seeker, occasional reseller
- **Seller**: destashing hobbyist, yarn reseller, small dyer

## Core user journeys
1. **Buyer finds deal** → search/filter → view listing → message/offer
2. **Seller lists bundle** → select yarns → auto‑fill weight → price → publish
3. **Seller manages offers** → accepts/declines → arranges payment/shipping

## Key features (MVP)
- Listings + bundles
- Search + filters
- Saved search alerts (optional)
- Offers/messaging (lightweight)
- Shipping estimate (heuristic)
- Yarn catalog typeahead (common yarns)

## Success metrics
- Listings posted/week
- Buyer search‑to‑message conversion
- Median time to first offer

## Risks
- Marketplace liquidity (chicken‑and‑egg)
- Trust/fraud without in‑app payments

## Open questions
- Do we handle payments in phase 1?
- Do we need a separate business entity for payments?
